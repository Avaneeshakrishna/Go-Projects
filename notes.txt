Project 1:
go-server: Build A Simple Web Server With Golang
How to start: 
    - cd to go-server: go mod init go-server
    - go build
    - go run main.go

Project 2: Build A CRUD API With Golang and TEST CRUD operations with Postman
    - Initialize a Go module using go mod init go-movies-crud.
    - Install the Gorilla Mux router with go get github.com/gorilla/mux.
    - Write Go code to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for your API.
    - Build the project using go build.
    - Run the server with go run main.go.
    - Use Postman to test each CRUD endpoint (create, read, update, delete) to ensure your API works as expected.
